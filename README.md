# <Repository Title>

## Description
This repository is a collection of solutions to the age-old problem: "Help, IT is going to delete my old emails!" These solutions were developed by business users across different departments at Michigan Medicine and the University of Michigan. Each solution was initially designed to meet specific department or project requirements, but can be customized to fit other needs. Most of the solutions presented use Microsoft Power Automate, though the same concepts apply to custom scripts or code that uses the Microsoft Graph API or local Outlook storage.



## Quick Start Guide

+ Follow the directions in the folder.
+ If it's a Power Automate solution, a .zip file is provided. To use it:

  + Click My Flows on the left menu
  + In the gray toolbar, click Import and upload the .zip file
