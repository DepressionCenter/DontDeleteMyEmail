# <Repository Title>

## Description
This repository is a collection of PowerAutomate workflows to backup emails. These solutions were developed by business users across different departments at Michigan Medicine and the University of Michigan. Each solution was initially designed to meet specific department or project requirements, but can be customized to fit other needs.

## Quick Start Guide
+ Use the folder navigation to browse through the different solutions, and follow the directions in the README file.
+ Under each folder, you will find the PowerAutomate flow in a compressed file (.zip), along with a README with a description of how the flow works and any settings you need to change before running it.
+ Download a copy of the .zip file for the solution you want to use
+ Go to https://make.powerautomate.com and login (MM users: user level-2 email)
+ Click _My_ _Flows_ on the left menu
+ In the gray toolbar at the top, click Import and upload the .zip file

+ When asked, enter your credentials for each connector by clicking the wrench icon. If this is your first time using PowerAutomate, or the first time you use that specific connector, the list will be empty. Click the + button to create a new credential (of the same type as the Resource Type listed). IMPORTANT: If you are a Michigan Medicine user, make sure to only use level-2 credentials.

+ Once all the credentials are setup, the Import button will turn blue. Click it to start the import.
+ Once your flow is imported, you can make any changes recommended in the README file by going back to _My_ _Flows_, and clicking the pencil icon next to the flow name.
